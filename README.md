# torch_dl
repo to test/demo deep learning with torch library.

souce data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/airfoil+self-noise

The neural network model was used to predict sound pressure level based on 5 inputs.

Initial data processing took into account any NA values, zeros and negative indicators to assess the outliers in the raw dataset. 

Historgram analysis showed normal distirbution across output value and no major out of sample values in the input data.

More work and learning to be done for advancing pytorch library knowledge.
